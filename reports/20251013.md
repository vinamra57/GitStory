# Weekly Status Report: 10/13/25

## Team Report

#### 1. <u>Last Week's Goals</u>
We drafted a detailed plan as to what the GitStory team wants to implement in the final product, designed specific commands, and completed the “Requirements & Team Policies” section in our Living Document.

In addition, we are currently finalizing the "Architecture and Design” portion of our Living Document, to be completed by Tuesday, 10/14/25 before 11:59 PM. We have added the following sections to our Living Document:
- *Section 6: Software Architecture* - by Vishal and Adwita
- *Section 7: Software Design* - by Ian and Derick
- *Section 8: Coding Guideline* - by Vinamra and ShengYao

#### 2. <u>Progress and Issues</u>

We received some feedback from our TA last Thursday. In response, the following issues were addressed and resolved in our updated Living Document (to be turned in on Tuesday, 10/14):
- Added the missing title for Living Document
- *Section 1: Team Information*
    - <u>TA feedback:</u> PM can’t be a full-time role for the scope of this course, team is missing someone to work on the UI
    - <u>Response to issue:</u> assigned additional responsibilities for ShengYao (originally just PM) as UI Designer and Frontend Developer
- *Section 2: Product Description*
    - <u>TA feedback:</u> the interactive visualization dashboard should perhaps be a major feature, or else the command-line interface should be sufficiently involved (e.g., many different queries, ways to fine-tune information, good displays/exports of the information and ways to interact with it).
    - <u>Response to issue:</u>
        - Changed Dashboard (static instead of interactive) from being a stretch goal to a major feature, added details on commands associated with dashboard and how to achieve it technically
        - Changed Time-Bound Summarization from being a stretch goal to a major feature
        - Added new stretch goals:
            - Commit Author Breakdown
            - Branch Comparison Mode
- *Section 3: Use Cases*
    - <u>TA feedback:</u> The use cases are too similar regarding motivations for different roles; use cases should be more about the system as the factor, not just humans. Also avoid paragraphs and use lists instead for the use cases to make reading the document easier.
    - <u>Response to issue:</u>
        - Reformatted every single use case into lists instead of paragraphs and made formatting more consistent
        - Added API rate limit handling (Case #5) and invalid directory detection (Case #6) to show GitStory acting autonomously, not just reacting to users.
        - Distinct features: 
            - Introduced sprint summaries (Case #2), HTML dashboards (Case #3), and branch comparison (Case #4) to differentiate workflows.
        - Greater complexity: combined user and system perspectives (Cases #1–6) to demonstrate broader functionality and project depth.
- *Section 5: Team Process Description*
    - Added subsections to make skimming the document easier
    - <u>TA feedback:</u> The majority of the risks are overly general… risks #2 (unrealistic deadlines) and 3 (temptation to choose the quick solution) would apply to every project… 
    - <u>Response to issue:</u> we removed the original risks #2 and 3 and came up with 4 new major risks. Now we have a total of 5 major risks:
        - AI integration complexity
        - Git repository variability
        - Summarization quality and evaluation
        - API key and configuration management
        - Static visualization report generation issues

Instead of adding an entire “Process Description” section into our Living Document, we updated the following sections to address these requirements for the sake of simplicity:
- “Major Risks” in Section 5 for “risk assessment” - added new risks and described more details on rating of each risk’s likelihood, impact, evidence, steps to reduce likelihood / improve estimates, plan for detecting the problem, and mitigation
- “Milestones Schedule” in Section 5 for “project schedule” - revised minor parts, added goals and plans for UI design and frontend
- Section 1: Team Information for “team structure” - described specific roles in details
- Section 5 (subheading: “Test Plan & Bugs”) for “test plan & bugs” - added this entire section
- Section 5 (subheading: “Documentation Plan”) for “documentation plan” - added this entire section
  
#### 3. <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

A decent amount of planning had been completed last week, and we are ready to move on to building our app with detailed initial setup instructions. While continuing to update our Living Document and Github repo, we aim to work on these things from now to the end of Friday 10/17/25:

- Adwita: Strengthen backend understanding by reviewing Python syntax and researching LLM–API integration to prepare for implementation.
- Derick: Finalize project architecture and design with the team; learn Python Click for CLI development; begin drafting testing requirements.
- Ian: Practice Python fundamentals and experiment with extracting commit histories from mock repositories; refine how commit data will be structured for the LLM.
- Vinamra: Continue refining documentation and testing plans; align MVP and stretch goals with feedback; ensure consistency across all sections of the living document.
- Vishal: Deepen understanding of how the LLM interfaces with the repo parser; validate architectural decisions and explore integration strategies for the CLI system.
- ShengYao: Create interactive mockup of front-end components on Figma; brainstorm how to turn everything into code.


## Individual Statuses

### Adwita Garg

#### 1. <u>Last Week's Goals</u>
*Empty because it is Week One*

#### 2. <u>Progress and Issues</u>

This week, I worked on developing the software architecture for GitStory, hashing out what GitStory’s components are, what they will look like, and how they will communicate with each other (interfaces). I learned how to structure the picture we all had in mind into an “architecture” format. All of us are now on the same page on how GitStory will work and its specific functions, which is great progress. I didn’t have any trouble this week/not stuck on anything currently.
  
#### 3. <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- By the end of Thursday 10/16, read up on the specific Python syntax we will be using (as it has been a while since I have coded in Python)
- By the end of Friday 10/17, research how our specific LLM will work with the Python code (i.e. how the API calls will work, how the backend code will work with the LLM, etc. as I don’t have much prior experience).


### Derick Chiem

#### 1. <u>Last Week's Goals</u>
*Empty because it is Week One*

#### 2. <u>Progress and Issues</u>

This week, I mostly worked on the software design part of the project documentation, where I (alongside Ian) defined the responsibilities of the software components within the architecture, as well as noting how those components will be implemented. There were no issues or roadblocks that we faced.
  
#### 3. <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Finalize project architecture and design with team members (By end of 10/14/2025)
- Familiarize myself with Python Click and it’s functionality (By end of 10/17/2025)
- Document testing requirements alongside team members (By end of 10/20/2025)


### Ian Limasi 

#### 1. <u>Last Week's Goals</u>
*Empty because it is Week One*

#### 2. <u>Progress and Issues</u>

I defined and organized the sub-components, technologies, and responsibilities of the LLM and Repo Parser components (Derick worked on the rest) that were mentioned in the architecture section. These definitions are organized into tables under the “Software Design” section. I learned that it’s oftentimes better to break down one big component into sub-components that utilize only one technology/package/class each. I did not face any troubles then and am not stuck now.
  
#### 3. <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Learn syntax and 6 essential data structures in Python, including how it differs from programming languages I’m more familiar with  such as Java and TypeScript (By end of 10/16/2025).
- Practice on extracting around 10 commit histories from a mock/temporary Git repository (By end of 10/17/2025).
- Research or discuss more with my teammates regarding what information from the commits are necessary for the LLM and how to categorize/structure them optimally (By end of 10/17/2025).


### Vinamra Agarwal

#### 1. <u>Last Week's Goals</u>
*Empty because it is Week One*

#### 2. <u>Progress and Issues</u>

This week, I worked on the Process Description component of the milestone, which involved significant restructuring based on TA feedback. I rescoped the project by revising our MVPs and stretch goals to better align with the course expectations and moved the Visualization Dashboard from a stretch goal to a major feature. I also made changes to the Team structure to address the missing UI role by expanding ShengYao's responsibilities. Additionally, I added comprehensive Testing and Documentation plans (new subsections in Section 5) for the project and worked on ensuring that all the different moving parts in the Living Document were aligned with one another — particularly making sure the risks, milestones, and team roles were consistent across sections. I learned how to identify meaningful project-specific risks rather than generic ones. I did not encounter any major blockers this week.
  
#### 3. <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Continue refining documentation and testing plans based on any additional feedback (By end of 10/16/2025)
- Ensure MVP and stretch goals remain aligned with team capabilities and TA expectations (By end of 10/17/2025)
- Review and verify consistency across all sections of the living document before submission (By 10/14/2025, 11:59 PM)
- Begin researching testing frameworks and strategies that will work best for our Python CLI application (By end of 10/17/2025)


### Vishal Sathambakkam

#### 1. <u>Last Week's Goals</u>
*Empty because it is Week One*

#### 2. <u>Progress and Issues</u>

This week, I worked on our software architecture and hashed out certain assumptions relating to the design of our system. I additionally evaluated two architectural design decisions and proposed viable alternatives (outlining certain pros/cons in user value/implementation possibility). This helped further rationalize our current approaches to make sure they were justified from a technical and usability standpoint. I did not run into any blockers in regards to this.
  
#### 3. <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Further understand and read into how our intended LLM will interface with repo parser, as this is essentially the bootstrap of our CLI application (by 10/16)
- Work on an implementation concept of repo history “feeding” into an LLM to guide thinking for development moving forward (ideally by EOD 10/17)
- Help review and ensure a consistent living document (by 10/14)


### ShengYao Liu

#### 1. <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

*Empty because it is Week One*

#### 2. <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- Completed Section 4. Nonfunctional Requirements portion of Living Document
Contributed Use Case #6 to Section 3: Use Cases (Functional Requirements)
- Set up communication channels for the team, attended specific team meetings to keep track of overall progress
- Formatted Living Document
- Kept track of team progress and completed the “Team Report” section of this week’s Weekly Status Report
- Revised Major Risks in Section 5 of Living Document according to TA feedback
- Updated Milestones Schedule (in Living Document Section 5) with “Front End / UI” section after amendment of Visualization Dashboard to Major Features (in Living Document Section 2)
- Learned software architecture, Git basics, and familiarized myself with technical terms introduced in lecture
- Struggled a bit with research on technical tools and how LLMs work, not sure how to coordinate these with my front-end stuff
Realized I’m REALLY rusty on HTML/CSS/JavaScript syntax and style and need to review a lot of things
  
#### 3. <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Create interactive mockup of command-line interface on Figma by Friday 10/17
- Create interactive mockup of visualization dashboard by Friday 10/17
- Review HTML/CSS/JavaScript syntax and style from Friday 10/17 to Tuesday 10/21 to better prepare myself for coding
Constantly update team goals and progress, adjust milestones schedule based on needs
- Big picture: for beyond next week, I will start writing code for front-end when others are ready to start coding, after Monday 10/20, since they’re still doing research and familiarizing themselves with our software architecture this week
